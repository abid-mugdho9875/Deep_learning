# Deep_learning
At first project, we use ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK(ANN) & CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) for image classification.We find that cnn is best for image clasification.
At second project,we use ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK(ANN) & CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK (CNN) for Hand Written Digit Classification.We find both of model work well.
At third project we try to create a dataset from small dataset using data augmentation technique.
At Last Project we try to use pretarined model to predict classifcation flower problem from dataset.
